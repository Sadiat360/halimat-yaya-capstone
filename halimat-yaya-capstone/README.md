# Project Title

## Overview

Arewa in Yoruba Language means (Beauty), Arewa is a E-commerce web-app for users to find beauty products that suits their needs.
### Problem Space


Beauty means different things to different people. However, as a woman, I can say that being called beautiful is something many of us hold dear. In today’s world, we often hear about the struggle to find the perfect beauty products that truly meet our needs. This is why *Arewa* was created.  

Many users spend endless hours searching websites that don’t prioritize their preferences or needs, often ending up frustrated by a complicated shopping experience. *Arewa* aims to change that by offering a simple, user-friendly solution that understands and caters to individual beauty needs, making the search for the perfect product effortless and enjoyable.
